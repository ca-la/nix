# Nix Development Environment

## Why?

To have a consistent development environment without the overhead of Docker or
other containerization services. Provides a consistent set of development
dependencies, such as NodeJS, PostgreSQL, ElasticMQ, pgcli, etc.

## Installing Nix

This repo uses a feature called `flakes` which is a feature that is opt-in. The
following directions are for macOS, and should be double checked against the
latest installation instructions available at the Nix homepage.
